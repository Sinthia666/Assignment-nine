            <p>Robi 10 Minute School is a platform that exists to provide students with a virtual world where they can get easy access to learning materials which can help them grow and prosper, free of cost. Ayman Sadiq is the Founder and CEO of the organization. Formerly a teacher at Mentors, the IBA graduate is now ready to develop his vision of creating an education platform which will put the needs of the countryâ€™s students first. Speaking to IBT, he detailed the story behind the inception of his startup and where he aims to take it.
                As of September 2020, the website has produced 19440+ video lessons, 1114+ SmartBooks, 49530+ quizzes and 1300+ blogs.[10][11][12]

                Starting in the last few days of July 2020, 10 Minute School got into internet controversy due to content considered to be against Islam by many Bangladeshi Muslims. Later in a video, Aymaan Sadiq apologised for the content, and claimed that all the controversial content had been deleted by the school from all its platforms.

                Some people claim that 10-minute school conducts excessive content reproduction.



                Ayman Sadiq founded 10 Minute School in mid-2014 as a YouTube channel.[4][5][6] Largely self-sponsored in the beginning, 10 Minute School did not initially have a website and solely reached students through educational infographics.[7] It started creating video tutorials for Mathematics and English and eventually started taking live classes on Facebook.[8] 10 Minute School went on to cover the entire academic syllabus from Class 1 to Class 12, university admission subjects covering topics from public and private university examinations and extensive software and skills training.[6]

                While one of the major challenges for an organization back then was to find a suitable sponsor to fund its operational activities, it later came to be supported by telecom operator Robi Axiata Limited and the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology.
